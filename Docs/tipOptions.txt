cb.tipOptions(func)
This function is only available to apps, not bots.

When users send a tip, present them with a list of messages to send with their tip. These messages can be received and processed later by cb.onTip(func).

Example Code
cb.tipOptions(function(user) {
    return {options:[{label: 'choice1'}, {label: 'choice2'},  {label: 'choice3'}],
            label:"Select a choice:"};
});
When a tip is received, the object will look like this:

{u'to_user': u'testuser', u'amount': 5, u'message': u'choice1',
         u'from_user': u'testuser2'}
Disabling tip options
If you no longer wish to display custom tip options and would prefer the user type his own message, simply return nothing.

cb.tipOptions(function(user) {
    // If we determine we want to show no custom tip options, do this . . .
    return;
});
